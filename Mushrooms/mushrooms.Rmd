## Introduction

Each year, many people fall ill and sometimes even die from ingesting poisonous wild mushrooms. Since many mushrooms are very similar to each other in appearance, occasionally even experienced mushroom gatherers are poisoned.

Unlike the identification of harmful plants, such as a poison oak or poison ivy, there are no clear rules like "leaves of three, let them be" for identifying whether a wild mushroom is poisonous or edible. Complicating matters, many traditional rules such as "poisonous mushrooms are brightly colored" provide dangerous or misleading information. If simple, clear, and consistent rules were available for identifying poisonous mushrooms, they could save the lives of foragers.

As one of the strengths of rule learning algorithms is the fact that they generate easy-to-understand rules, they seem like an appropriate fit for this classification task. However, the rules will only be as useful as they are accurate.

## Collecting, Exploring and Preparing the data

We will be using a dataset donated to the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml) by Hans Hofmann of the University of Hamburg. The dataset contains information on loans obtained from a credit agency in Germany.

For ease to acces the dataset I have hosted a public repository and included the code that directly downloads the data from the repo and loads the data. The path can be canged to anythig according to your preference of the working directory.

```{r}
path <- "A:/Project/Mushrooms"
setwd(path)
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shreyaskhadse/data_files/master/mushrooms.csv"
datafile <- "./mushrooms.csv"
if (!file.exists(datafile)) {
    download.file(url, datafile ,method="auto") }
mushrooms <- read.csv("mushrooms.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
str(mushrooms)
```

The dataset includes information on 8,124 mushroom samples from 23 species of gilled mushrooms listed in the Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). In the field guide, each of the mushroom species is identified as "definitely edible," "definitely poisonous," or "likely poisonous, and not recommended to be eaten." For the purposes of this dataset, the latter group was combined with the "definitely poisonous" group to make two classes: poisonous and non-poisonous. The data dictionary available on the UCI website describes the 22 features of the mushroom samples, including characteristics such as cap shape, cap color, odor, gill size and color, stalk shape, and habitat.

the veil type does not vary across samples, it does not provide any useful information for prediction since there is only one factor level. We will drop this variable from our analysis.

```{r}
mushrooms$veil_type <- NULL
```

Observing the distribution of the mushroom type variable in our dataset

```{r}
levels(mushrooms$type) <- c('edible','poisonous')
table(mushrooms$type)
```

About 52 percent of the mushroom samples (N = 4,208) are edible, while 48 percent (N = 3,916) are poisonous.

For the purposes of this experiment, we will consider the 8,214 samples in the mushroom data to be an exhaustive set of all the possible wild mushrooms. This is an important assumption because it means that we do not need to hold some samples out of the training data for testing purposes. We are not trying to develop rules that cover unforeseen types of mushrooms; we are merely trying to find rules that accurately depict the complete set of known mushroom types. Therefore, we can build and test the model on the same data.

## Taining a model on the Data

We will use the 1R implementation found in the OneR package by Holger von Jouanne-Diedrich at the Aschaffenburg University of Applied Sciences. This is a relatively new package, which implements 1R in native R code for speed and ease of use.

```{r}
#install.packages("OneR")
library(OneR)
mushroom_1R <- OneR(type ~ ., data = mushrooms)
mushroom_1R
```

Examining the output, we see that the `odor` feature was selected for rule generation. The categories of `odor`, such as `almond`, `anise`, and so on, specify rules for whether the mushroom is likely to be `edible` or `poisonous`. For instance, if the mushroom smells `fishy`, `foul`, `musty`, `pungent`, `spicy`, or like `creosote`, the mushroom is likely to be poisonous. On the other hand, mushrooms with more pleasant smells, like `almond` and `anise`, and those with no smell at all, are predicted to be edible.

## Evaluating Model Performance

The last line of the output notes that the rules correctly predict the edibility 8,004 of the 8,124 mushroom samples, or nearly 99 percent. Anything short of perfection, however, runs the risk of poisoning someone if the model were to classify a poisonous mushroom as edible.

```{r}
mushroom_1R_pred <- predict(mushroom_1R, mushrooms)
table(actual = mushrooms$type, predicted = mushroom_1R_pred)
```

Examining the table, we can see that although the 1R classifier did not classify any edible mushrooms as poisonous, it did classify 120 poisonous mushrooms as edibleâ€” which makes for an incredibly dangerous mistak.

## Improving Model Performance

For a more sophisticated rule learner, we will use `JRip()`, a Java-based implementation of the RIPPER algorithm. The `JRip()` function is included in the `RWeka` package.

```{r}
#install.packages("RWeka")
library(RWeka)
mushroom_JRip <- JRip(type ~ ., data = mushrooms)
mushroom_JRip
```

The `JRip()` classifier learned a total of nine rules from the mushroom data.

The numbers next to each rule indicate the number of instances covered by the rule and a count of misclassified instances. Notably, there were no misclassified mushroom samples using these nine rules. As a result, the number of instances covered by the last rule is exactly equal to the number of edible mushrooms in the data (N = 4,208).
